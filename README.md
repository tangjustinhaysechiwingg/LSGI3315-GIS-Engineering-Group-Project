Abstract

A variety of sports and outdoor facilities can enrich humanâ€™s quantity of life and improve human physical and mental health. In this study, we explored the sports and outdoor facilities in Hong Kong through geospatial aspect and there are some key findings on it. At first, a majority of sports and outdoor facilities in Hong Kong are located in the tourist attractions, residential areas and new towns in Hong Kong. In addition, using badminton court as a specific facility type, a majority of the urban areas are within a reasonable walking distance (i.e., 500 m), such as the Western and Eastern part of Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and new towns in the New Territories. Also, the good coverage of badminton courts in Hong Kong are situated in Kwun Tong , Wong Tai Sin and Yau Tsim Mong District. Last but not least, a majority of the sports facilities are highly accessible in transportation within 100 meters, except country park. The group project is meaningful for students to perform various customized spatial analysis via Python programming.
